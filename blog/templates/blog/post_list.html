	<p><b><u>Case Study:</b></u> Tax implications arising from the acquisition of a real estate property in Kefalonia (Greece).</p>
	<p><b><u>Problem:</b></u> Assume that an individual of Swedish Nationality and Tax Residency examines to purchase a 100 square meters house in 
				a village of Paliki prefecture in the Kefalonia Island. The house will be purchased at an agreed price of 200,000 euros, 
				needs refurbishment and maintenance works of 50,000 euros and is planned to be loaned to 3d parties for 2 months every year. 
				The individual plans to sell the house to a 3d party or to transfer it to his children over a period of 5 years.
				Which are the tax implications that arise for the individual over a time period of 5 years for buying-holding-selling the house?</p>
	<p><b><u>Solution:</b></u> Tax implications may be grouped in categories that reflect the major stages of the building life cycle: acquisition – holding – selling/transferring. 
			More precisely, tax implications arise from:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Acquiring the property
				<li>Annual maintenance works
				<li>Leasing the property to 3d parties
				<li>Selling the property a 3d party of transferring it to relatives
			</ul>
	<p>Assuming that an individual of Swedish Nationality and Tax Residency wishes to purchase a house at an agreed cost of 200,000 euros which is equal to the objective value of the property, 
		the following graphs depict all tax categories that arise during the 5 year life cycle of holding the building.</p>
<div class="graph">{% include 'blog/gchart1.html' %} <br> <b><u>Definition of terms:</b></u><br>RETT = Real Estate Transfer Tax = (3%) x (objective value of property)<br>
					Municipality Duty = (3%) x (RETT)<br>ENFIA = Annual Real Estate Tax = 2 - 13 euros/sqm for buildings<br>VAT = 23% for all refurbishment and maintenance works<br>
					(all costs are expressed in euros)

	<p>The alternatives on the other hand, of acquiring a real estate property in Greece are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Direct acquisition by the individual
				<li>Indirect acquisition from a legal entity established to the abroad
			</ul>
	<p><b><u>Note:</b></u> Due to the introduction of the new Greek Income Tax Code (G-ITC) and the recent change in Government, uncertainties may occur in the interpretation of 
		the specific provisions by the Greek Ministry of Economy and the local authorities of Kefalonia Island.</p>
	<p>The major differences between acquiring the house directly from the individual and indirectly from a legal entity established to the abroad are:</p>
